There was a plotting error in the track of one of these two approaches resulting in the duplication of a length of coastline of c. 13' of longitude in extent, between Gourdin Island and Cape Ducorps. For this reason, between Siffrey Point and Coupvent Point, a single series of features appeared twice on the original chart and were named twice (d'Urville, 1838, map following p.1170). It is now clear that the names Roche Lafarge and Roche Coupvent both refer to the feature now named Lafarge Rocks (q.v.), and the names Île Casy and Roche Duroch to Casy Island (q.v.).

Extensive calving took place along the ice front between February 1972 and January 1974, as revealed by USLANDSAT imagery (Colvill, 1977, p.391-92). Following further calving as revealed in USLANDSAT imagery of February 1979, the ice shelf was seen to extend W only to Napier Ice Rise, whereas in 1949 it had extended W to Bugge Islands. [Wordie Point, Visokoi Island, South Sandwich Islands, is also named after Sir J.M. Wordie (Hattersley-Smith, 1980b, p.97).]  Massive break-up of this ice shelf has led almost to its disappearance as an entity; several of the ice rises contained in it may have become islands, e.g.  Napier and Reynolds ice rises (Doake and Vaughan, p. 328-30). Some of the ice rises have disappeared altogether, e.g. Linchpin and Miller Ice Rises. Landsat-7 satellite imagery in Dec. 2004 showed that all of the shelf ice had broken away, leaving floating glaciers which appeared to be undergoing significant calving.
